# Water-level-Indicator
This sensor can be used to measure the water level, monitor a sump pit, detect rainfall or detect leakage.
Hardware Overview
The sensor has a series of ten exposed copper traces, five of which are power traces and five are sense traces.
These traces are interlaced so that there is one sense trace between every two power traces.
Usually these traces are not connected but are bridged by water when submerged.
How Water Level Sensor Works?
The working of the water level sensor is pretty straightforward.The series of exposed parallel conductors, together acts as a variable resistor (just like a potentiometer) whose resistance varies according to the water level.
The change in resistance corresponds to the distance from the top of the sensor to the surface of the water.
The resistance is inversely proportional to the height of the water:
The more water the sensor is immersed in, results in better conductivity and will result in a lower resistance.
The less water the sensor is immersed in, results in poor conductivity and will result in a higher resistance.
The sensor produces an output voltage according to the resistance, which by measuring wecan determine the water level.
